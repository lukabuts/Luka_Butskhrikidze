# Live Coding Project

This project was created during a live coding session. The purpose of the session was to build a simple website that features a sale countdown, dynamic pricing updates, and a popup for more information.

## Description

The Sale Countdown Website is a responsive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a visually appealing countdown timer for an ongoing sale event. Once the sale concludes, the displayed price for the featured product dynamically disappears to signify the end of the sale. Users can interact with the site by clicking on the "See More" button, triggering a popup that provides additional information about the product or promotion.
